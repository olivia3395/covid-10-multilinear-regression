# covid-19-multilinear-regression

This project aims to use multi-linear regression to analyze COVID-19 confirmed cases using county demo- graphic, economic and medical information. 


It provides statistical analysis on how these factors affect the number of confirmed cases in each county, and make predictions for countries using regression model. The results show that the countries with larger population,
greater population growth, with more severe aging trend, more developed urbanization, and the countries with a large number of immigrants, tend to have more confirmed cases, possibly due to dense population, highly urbanization, developed economic conditions, and better detection methods.


Keywords: COVID-19; confirmed cases; multi-linear regression; prediction.
